Custom Report Framework for PowerSchool
===================

PowerSchool customization:  Provides a custom report menu in PowerSchool.  Contains components for creating custom reports that can be detected by the menu system.

This project is based on the original Custom Reports Bundle(CRB) customization.  The main difference is that this report strips away the reports, dashboards, and sqlReports customization that are provided in the CRB.  What is left is a menu system and framework that gives developers a set of tools and guidelines for adding their own report packages into the custom report menu.
